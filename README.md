# CUNYCosmos
CUNY Cosmos is an application that acts as a resource for CUNY (The City University of New York) students interested in pursuing opportunities in the space industry. It is a desktop app built with QT Framework and C++11.

This app is developed by Natasha Kamara Martinez under the supervision of Dr. Azhar as an Honors Project for the course CSC211H Advanced Programming Techniques.

# Inspiration for CUNY Cosmos
The inspiration for CUNY Cosmos came when I was participating in NASA's L'SPACE Mission Concept Academy. My professor had expressed to me how a lot of students arent aware of a lot of the opportunities they can pursue in the space industry, and how this is especially true for CUNY students as careers in the space industry are not promoted. CUNY Cosmos can help bridge the gap between CUNY students and careers in space by providing them with a multitude of opportunities. From community college students to those pursuing graduate studies, my mission is to open up a universe of opportunities, making space accessible to all.

# Project Description
This app contains information about different internships, fellowships, and programs tailored for students at different stages of their academic journey. It also provides information on professionals in the space industry, why careers in space are imporant, and users can also opt in to take a mini "space quiz". 

# Challenges 
Some challenges I faced while building the app were ...

1. Getting accustomed to the environment of Qt Creator. It was my first time building any sort of project, especially with C++, so I had a lot to learn. Thankfully, there is an abundance of resources online to help guide you when it comes to using Qt Creator. StackOverflow and the Qt Creator Forum were a big help when it came to any questions I had regarding my project. 

2. I had trouble visualizing how I wanted my project to look and how users would be able to navigate it. My goal was to make the app as user friendly as possible. After experiementing with the UI, I was able to finalize the way I wanted the project to look. 

# Accomplishments

I was able to apply concepts that I learned in my 211H course along with learning the Qt Framework.

# In the future..

I'd like to incorporate a database to store information.
