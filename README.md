# CUNYCosmos
CUNY Cosmos is an application that can act as a resource for CUNY students interested in pursuing opportunities in the space industry. It is a desktop app built with QT Framework and C++11.

# Inspiration for CUNY Cosmos
The inspiration for CUNY Cosmos came as I was participating in NASA's L'SPACE Mission Concept Academy. My professor had expressed me to how a lot of students arent aware of a lot of the opportunities they can pursue in the space industry, and this is especially true for CUNY students as careers in the space industry are not promoted. CUNY Cosmos can help bridge the gap between CUNY students and careers in space by providing them with a multitude of opportunities. From community college students to those pursuing graduate studies, my mission is to open up a universe of opportunities, making space accessible to all.

# Project Description
This app contains information about different internships, fellowships, and programs that students can pursue depending on their class level. It also provides information on different professionals in the space industry, why careers in space are imporant, and users can even opt in to take a mini "space quiz".
